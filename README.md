# Exposure-to-Color-Anxiety---SAS

Project was based to check the validity of Chromotherapy

Tasks performed:
1. Survey
2. Data Clean & Analysis
3. Presentation

Survey population (n=48)

Data analysis performed example:

Hypothesis Testing for Blocking effect (Age group of the experimental units)
[Ho]:[⍴i] =0
[H𝛼] : not all ⍴i are zero
Test Statistic: [F * = (MSRow /MSRem) = (90.7986/5.994518) = 15.1469]
Decision Rule:
[if F * < F(r-1,n*r2-3*r+2) (1-𝛼) = 2.852, conclude Ho]
[if F * > F(r-1,n*r2-3*r+2) (1-𝛼) = 2.852, conclude H𝛼]
